- 👋 Hi, I’m @brphelps
- I'm interested in 🕸 development technologies (React and the variety of flux implementations), software engineering (striking the balance between maintainability and pragmatism), and open source supply chains.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how do be a decent Rails developer, and likely soon a Go developer 😉.
- 💞️ I'm looking for a good 10% project to pick up that's maybe close to -- but not *too* close to -- my wheelhouse. 
- 📫 You can email me! brphelps@github.com
